                                <h3>Vision and Beginning - Frazer Town, Bangalore</h3>
                                <p>Since Bangalore city is close to the border of the Andhra state, we observe that many people from Andhra come and settle here. <strong>Bro. Nandipogu Ankaiah Joseph (N. A. Joseph)</strong>, who came from one such family, was working in HMT Factory and was in fellowship at Mizpah Telugu Church. He was encouraged by God to work among the Telugu people.</p>
                                <p>Following the Lord's inspiration, dear Bro. N. A. Joseph, along with the believers of that time, received permission to gather in the St. John's Church Parish Hall in the Frazer Town area. Submitting to the command and will of God, the ever-present Helper, they started the assembly named '<strong>Ebenezer Telugu Worship Home</strong>' in the name of the Lord in July 1965. Many believers joined the assembly and eagerly participated in the ministry while continuing their vocations. The ministry continued there for about 4 years.</p>
                                <p>In the public meetings held during those days, dear Bro. V. Sambabu (Kadapa), who was a youth then and was being effectively used, Bro. S. Anandam (Vetapalem), and some other men of God preached the Word and greatly strengthened the assembly.</p>

                                <h3>Dedication to Service and the Gospel - Haudin Road, Ulsoor</h3>
                                <p>In 1969, they took a house on rent in the 'Haudin Road, Ulsoor' area and continued the ministry. The name of the assembly was changed to '<strong>Shalem Telugu Worship Home</strong>.'</p>
                                <p>Knowing God's call and His will, dear Bro. N. A. Joseph resigned from his job in 1971 and dedicated himself to full-time ministry. Along with his dear wife, Sister Devaamma garu, who assisted him in the ministry, he continued in the full-time service of the Lord. Bro. N. A. Joseph's sons and daughters-in-law also joined the fellowship.</p>
                                <p>For about ten years until 1981, while the assembly continued there, God granted grace to preach the Gospel in various areas of Andhra and local areas like Ulsoor, Jalahalli, Yelahanka, Whitefield, HAL, Domlur, Koramangala, and Gandhi Nagar, alongside Bro. Stephen (who worked in Cornerstone World Challenge) and many beloved church members on various occasions. They also shared the Gospel by screening the 'Jesus' film whenever feasible. Many people were saved and joined the assembly. The name of God was glorified.</p>
                                <p>At that time, dear Bro. Christopher (Transport Company), Bro. Prabhudas (HAL), Bro. Paul Samuel (Indian Railways), Bro. Moses (BEL), Bro. Guruprasad, and many others were co-workers in the ministry, being zealous for the work of the Lord.</p>
                                <p>Dear Bro. Samson (Bible Book Shop, who is currently an Elder of the local assembly), Elder Edward Swaminathan garu, Bro. Elia, and others joined newly in 1981.</p>

                                <h3>Steadfastness and Expansion - Domlur, Bangalore</h3>
                                <p>Due to some unfavourable circumstances in the gathering place at Ulsoor, they gathered at dear Bro. Moses' house in Gun Troop for about three years. Soon after, God made arrangements for the assembly to gather in the Domlur area.</p>
                                <p>Due to the unfriendliness of the local people in this area, dear Bro. N. A. Joseph and the assembly had to face many oppositions. However, the Lord was with them, strengthened them, and established His assembly's testimony in this area. Consequently, we observe that today it is recognized as the '<strong>Domlur Assembly</strong>' among the Telugu assemblies.</p>
                                <p class="highlight-text">Man of God N. A. Joseph garu had many spiritual gifts. He preached the Word effectively, spoke about 5 languages, wrote songs, composed music for them, and sang them. He was skilled in music. The songs "Yesuve Na Balamu..." (The Lord Jesus is My Strength...), "Ettaina Kotaga Prabhu Yesu..." (Lord Jesus as a High Tower...), and many others were included in the Christian Hymns (Kraisthava Sunaada Geethamulu). He loved to preach the Gospel while playing the Kanjira and Harmonium.</p>
                                <p>Despite having opportunities in various ways and languages, it is joyful that he continued the ministry given to him by God among the Telugu people until the end. God made the CPWD Hall in the Domlur area available for this ministry for a long time. Thanks be to God for that.</p>
                                <p>As the ministry continued, God added some more beloved ones to the ministry. Dear Bro. James, Bro. Yesudas, Bro. Samuel, Bro. Mark, Bro. Matthew, Bro. Moses, Bro. Aaron, Bro. Israel, Bro. Gabriel, Bro. Thomas, Bro. George (Musalaiah), Bro. Venkatram, Bro. Devakumar, and others participated as co-workers in the ministry. Thanks be to the Lord for them. While men of God like Bro. Somababu, Bro. G. Rajarao, Bro. Paul Gandhi, Bro. Gopal Reddy, Bro. Raj Paul, and many others shared the Word in special meetings, dear Bro. Martur Uday Kishore led in the songs. Those days were very joyful.</p>

                                <h3>Transition and Continuation</h3>
                                <p>As the ministry progressed, Bro. N. A. Joseph garu fell ill in 2000. When he became physically weak, God strengthened those who stood firm in the assembly for the ministry. When dear Bro. N. A. Joseph became weaker in 2007, according to God's arrangement, dear Bro. Babu Rao, Bro. Cornelli, Bro. Thomas, Bro. Johnson, Bro. Samson (currently Elder), Bro. James, and Bro. Abraham (currently Elder) stood up and continued the ministry. Later, they were recognized as Elders for the local assembly.</p>
                                <p>Based on the need in the assembly, the 'Sunday School' ministry was started. The Lord made it possible to preach the Gospel in various areas and to have co-workers for the Gospel. In this phase, dear Bro. Samuel John and Bro. Jeevaratnam greatly helped in the ministry of the Word. We are thankful to them.</p>
                                <p>In 2010, dear Bro. N. A. Joseph passed away in the Lord, concluding his journey of faith and service. Thanks be to God for the life of His servant, who left an indelible mark among the Telugu assemblies in Bangalore.</p>

                                <h3>Establishment and Growth</h3>
                                <p>Due to the opposition from non-local people and the need to comply with government regulations, God granted grace to form the '<span class="highlight-text">Domlur Brethren Assembly Trust (DBAT)</span>' in 2011. God determined that this trust should assist the church and be under the supervision of the church Elders, and God is enabling it to continue in the same manner until today. May glory be to God for that!</p>
                                <p>God strengthened our hands to assist and participate in the work of evangelists involved in ministry through the Andhra Believers Society (ABS), a few missionaries working in North Indian states who went from the Telugu states, and some men of God working in Karnataka state. This ministry continues to be fragrant in His sight.</p>
                                <p>God expanded the ministry according to His will. As a result, the Sisters Fellowship, Youth Fellowship, Family Conference, and Vacation Bible School (VBS) were started. Many believed and were baptized. They gathered together. Based on the need of the ministry, dear Bro. Anjaiah was appointed as a Deacon in 2014, and in the following year, dear Bro. N. Joseph was recognized as an Elder in the local assembly and joined the ministry.</p>
                                <p class="scripture-reference">"So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase." - 1 Corinthians 3:7</p>
                                <p class="highlight-text">As the ministry expanded and many joined, situations arose where the gathering place was not enough. Some people had to sit in the awning outside and worship the Lord. As the assembly prayed and strived according to the Lord's counsel, after about two years, according to His will, God opened doors for the ministry in the Whitefield area in 2015. May glory be to Him!</p>

                                <p>God preserved the assembly during the COVID situation. During that time, God made it possible to help many men of God and non-local people in need through the assembly. Based on the need, a YouTube channel (Shalem & Ebenezer Brethren Assemblies Bengaluru) was started, and God is helping to continue it for the benefit of many.</p>
                                <p>Dear Bro. Johnson, who served as a Church Elder for some time, voluntarily stepped down from the responsibility of Elder, giving opportunity to the next generation due to personal reasons. Following the guidance of the Holy Spirit, dear Bro. Kiran Kumar, Bro. Praveen, and Bro. Srinivas joined the ministry as Church Elders.</p>
                                <p>From 2022 for some time, God granted grace to gather and worship in the Good Shepherd Community Hall. In 2023, dear Bro. Devadanam joined the ministry as an Elder, and Bro. Ravi Kumar, Bro. Joseph Chittibabu, Bro. Silas Babu, Bro. Paul Benjamin, Bro. Silas Rondla, and Bro. Immanuel were appointed as Deacons.</p>
