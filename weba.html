                                    <p>As a result of nearly 2 years of prayer and effort, God opened doors to start the ministry in the Whitefield area, on the campus of St. Joseph's Convent. Sis. Arogyam, the in-charge of the Kannada school, cooperated by providing one classroom for worship and another room for Sunday School, covering the monthly maintenance and other expenses, thus enabling them to gather as a church.</p>

                            <p>On February 8, 2015, they began gathering as a church and breaking bread. Man of God, Varaprasad Reddy garu, was invited to this worship meeting. This new assembly was named "WhiteField Ebenezar Brethren Assembly (WEBA)."</p>
                            <p class="highlight-text">The assembly started with 5 families sent from the Shalem Telugu Worship Home (STWH) church:</p>
                            <ul class="families-list">
                                <li>Bro. Jacob's family</li>

                            <p>At the same time, Bro. John Timothy's family came from Chennai and joined the local church fellowship. May glory be to the Lord because of these first families!</p>

                            <p>With Christ as the Head, both STWH and WEBA assemblies continue to work together smoothly in the ministry. All praise to the Father God for the unity granted by the Spirit!</p>
                            <p>For the local church ministry, Bro. Srinivas, Bro. John Timothy, and Bro. Praveen were appointed as deacons to assist Elder Bro. Jacob. Fellowship meetings, the Souvenir, STWH 8th monthly gospel meetings, and a ministry caring for families were started for the expansion of the church. Elder Bro. Abraham's family was sent through the Domlur assembly and carried out the local church ministry.</p>
                            <p class="highlight-text">The way the Domlur church bore the burden for the growth of the assembly, both in the ministry of the Word and in every financial need, is truly exemplary. We can never forget their love.</p>
                            <p>Based on the need, subsequently, the 'Youth Meeting' and 'Sisters' Ministry' were started.</p>

                            <p>As the church grew, the gathering place became cramped, so an old lab room on the same campus was renovated, and they started gathering there from August 8, 2018. This provided space for about 80 people to gather. Thanks to God, who granted the convent management a good heart. May God give them a suitable reward!</p>

                            <p>By the grace of God, many families joined the church. As the church grew and the ministry expanded, Bro. Srinivas and Bro. Praveen were appointed as Elders, and Bro. Paul Benjamin, Bro. Silas Bond, and Bro. Immanuel were appointed as Deacons. By the grace of God, they are continuing in the ministry.</p>
